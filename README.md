# cosan 

### Overview:
We aim to write an open-source machine learning library Cosan for C++ which provides a data mining and data predictive analytics framework. It implements a selected range of simple and efficient data processing procedures and machine learning algorithms and is designed to interoperate with C++ scientific computing library Eigen/xtensor.
