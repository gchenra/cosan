# Cosan

### Overview:
We aim to write an open-source machine learning library Cosan for C++ which provides a data mining and data predictive analytics framework. It implements a selected range of simple and efficient data processing procedures and machine learning algorithms and is designed to interoperate with C++ scientific computing library Eigen/xtensor. 

### Introduction:

### Design: 

The distance between \f$(x_1,y_1)\f$ and \f$(x_2,y_2)\f$ is 
  \f$\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}\f$.
