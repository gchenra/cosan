### Model Selection and Evaluation Design Document

##### Purpose and Functionalities 
	The main purpose of the model selection and evaluation part is to offer 
	tools to evaluate the linear models with the preprocessed data. \\
	We will implement four different metrics to measure the error rates of the 
	predicted labels from linear models. These metrics are max error(), mean absolute 
	error(), mean squared error(), and r2 score().
